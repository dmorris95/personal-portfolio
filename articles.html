    <h2>AI and Meetings - January 2024</h2>
    <h4><a href="https://theconversation.com/ai-can-now-attend-a-meeting-and-write-code-for-you-heres-why-you-should-be-cautious-217733">AI and Meetings</a></h4>
    <p>The article talks about how some AIs are capable of summarizing meetings and providing you notes on the meeting. While I think this could be useful in certain situations, it does not make up for a person actually being at the meeting and listening with their own ears. Picking up cadence and certain tones can be difficult for AI and a person would have a much easier time understanding the meeting by just being there.</p>

    <h2>Teaching a Computer to Type - April 2024</h2>
    <h4><a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2024/04/240418165214.htm">Teaching a Computer to Type</a></h4>
    <p>This article goes over how instead of a computer predicting a human's typing they were able to simulate a human typing. The computer made typing errors and had to go back and fix them as well as being run through a ton of different typing challenges. I found this interesting because of the way they tested the computer and the computer was able to realize it made typos and went back and fixed them.</p>
